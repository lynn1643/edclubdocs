<h1>Scoreboard and leaderboard</h1>
<p>Scoreboard is one of the motivational tools offered on TypingClub School Edition. It allows students to view each others' scores and try to outperform each other to grab the highest spot. If you prefer that students focus on their own individual performance instead, you can turn the scoreboard off.</p>
<br/>
