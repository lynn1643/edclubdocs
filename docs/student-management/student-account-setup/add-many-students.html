<h1>Add many students</h1>

<p>We offer a few methods to easily add a larger population of students to your account. You can use our Google Classroom integration, Class Codes, or one of our import tools.<br/>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h2>Google Classroom</h2>
      <p>
         <i>Rostering from Google Classroom will both create your student accounts and roster your classes in one easy step.</i>
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>Go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab.</li>
         <li>Click <span class="tab">Google Classroom</span>.</li>

         <li>Click the <b>Import</b> button for each class you'd like to import.</li>
      </ol><br/>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h2>Class Codes <span class="icon-new"></span></h2>
      <p>
         <i>Class codes can allow your students to both join your account and/or enroll in a class.</i>
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>Go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and choose the class you want students to be able to join.</li>
         <li>On the right side of the screen, check the box next to <b>Students can join this class.</b></li>
         <li>Share the class code or the URL with students.</li>
      </ol><br/>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h2>Add Many Students Wizard </h2>
      <p>
         <i>Best for small accounts with a few classes. To both create accounts and enroll in one step, rosters must be uploaded individually for each class.</i> Download a CSV template file here: <a href="{{ EDC_SRC }}media/csv/student-import-wizard.csv" target="_blank">Add Many Students Wizard CSV template file</a>.<br/>

      <ol>
         <li>Go to the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab.</li>
         <li>Click the <span class="tab">Add Many Students</span> tab. Here you can find instructions on how to format a CSV file containing your students' names and some identifying information.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Next Step</b> to get more information on how to create a CSV file. The following are the required fields for your preferred login setup:<br />

         <li>Click <b>Next</b> to preview your roster. </li>
         <li>If you have imported a single class, you may enroll all students to a class you have already created. This is optional and all students can be enrolled in classes later.</li>
         <li>If you are a district administrator and you have added schools to your account, you can choose a school for the students here.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Finalize Import</b>. You will now see all of the students from your CSV file appear under the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab. </li>

      <h2>Data Import Tool </h2>
      <p>
         <i>Best for large accounts and districts, student IDs and class IDs are required for a successful upload of all students at once.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Go to <span class="tab">Settings</span> and scroll down to click the <b>Data Import Tool</b>. Here you can see the link on the right side of the screen titled <b>Students</b>. Clicking this link will give you information for required fields in the students.csv file. You can download a template file here: <a href="{{ EDC_SRC }}media/csv/data-import-tool-students.csv" target="_blank">Student CSV template file</a>.<br/></p>
      <p>Let's take a look at the fields required for a successful upload:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <h5>Required fields:</h5>
         </li>
         <ul>
            <li><b>student-id:</b> your internal ID, no special form is required </li>
            <li><b>class-id:</b> required if you want to automatically enroll students in their respective classes. Make sure that class IDs have been properly assigned.</li>
            <li><b>school-id:</b> required only if you have more than one school</li>
            <li><b>first name:</b> students' first names</li>
            <li><b>username <i>or</i> email</b>: if students log in with a single sign-on, email must be entered. If no email address is provided, please add a username and a password.</li>
         </ul>
         <br>
         <li>
            <h5>Optional fields:</h5>

            <li><b>grade</b>: including a grade will help you more easily sort through your classes in the future</li>
            <li><b>action:</b> use the word "update" for all rows in your spreadsheet to add or update student information, or the word "delete" to remove it. </li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Once you have created your csv file, make sure to save it, return to the Data Import Tool page, and upload the file. Uploading may take a couple of minutes depending on the size of the file. Check the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab to make sure that students from your spreadsheet have populated in your account, and the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab to verify that students are properly enrolled in their respective classes.</p>
