<h2>How do I set lesson plan dependency?</h2>
<p>Lesson plan dependency is a great tool if you have multiple lesson plans assigned to a class, but want students to work in a certain order. Here are two options for how to go about this:</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h5>Students can work on all lesson plans assigned to a class.</h5>
      <p>Lesson plan dependency is set to "None" by default, which means that students can work on all lesson plans assigned to this class.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h5>Students must work on lesson plans in a set order.</h5>
      <p>If you want to control the order in which students work on lesson plans, you can set one lesson plan to be dependent upon completion of another.</p>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>To set dependency, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and select your class by clicking its name. Once inside the class, click the <b>Lesson Plans</b> link at the top. You will see a list of lesson plans assigned to the class. Dependency is set to "None" by default. If you click the <b>None</b> link, you will have the option to choose the lesson plan on which the current plan is dependent.</p>
<div class="doc-notice"><b>Note:</b>The dependent lesson plan will not appear on the student dashboard until they have finished the previous plan.</div>
