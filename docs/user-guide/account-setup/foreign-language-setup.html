<h1>Foreign language setup</h1>
<p>TypingClub is a typing tool initially designed for English speakers. As it grew and gained popularity, users around the world began requesting more language options to accommodate the various keyboard layouts. Today, the program can be configured to provide a native experience for speakers of the following languages: Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Slovak. To set up the student experience, follow the next steps:</p><br>
<ol>
<li><h2
>Install &amp; Assign Lesson Plan</h2> 
<p>Every class on TypingClub is automatically assigned our default lesson plan Typing Jungle (designed for typing in English). The lesson plans in other languages must be installed on your account and then assigned to your classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Lesson Plans</li>
<li>Open the Lesson Plan Library</li> 
<li>Locate the lesson plan of your choice and install it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>Once the lesson plan is installed, assign it to your classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <span class="tab">Classes</span> and open your class</li>
<li>Click the <b> Lesson Plans</b> link </li>
<li>Click <b>Assign Lesson Plan to This Class</b> and browse the list of installed lesson plans</li>
<li>Optional: Unassign Typing Jungle</li>
</ul>
<br>

>Update Keyboard Settings</h2>
<p>By default, students are able to choose their preferred keyboard layout. However, teachers have the option to select the layout for the entire class and thus lock the keyboard settings for the students. You might benefit from this option in a large-class setting as it ensures that everyone's account is pre-configured correctly. </p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <span class="tab">Classes</span> and open your class</li>
<li>Click the <b>Student Settings</b> link </li>
<li>Lock Keyboard Language and Layout</li>
<li>Hit <b>Update Settings</b> to save</li>
</ul>

<li><h2
>Interface Language</h2>
<p>Finally, when students log into their accounts, they can update the language of their account in the top-right corner of their screen. This is the only setting that must be configured by the student. Updating the language of the interface is highly recommended as the entire communication of the program with the student will happen in the language selected.</p>
